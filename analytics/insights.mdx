## Recommendations

### System Prompt Suggestions

AI suggests prompt improvements:

```markdown
## Current Prompt Issue
Agent often misses collecting company name early in calls.

## Suggested Addition
After greeting, add: "May I ask what company you're calling from? 
This helps me provide more relevant information."

## Expected Impact
+15% company name capture rate based on similar changes.
```

### Knowledge Base Gaps

Identify missing content:

```
Top Questions Without Good Answers
────────────────────────────────────
1. "What's the lead time for custom orders?" (23 occurrences)
2. "Do you ship internationally?" (18 occurrences)
3. "What's your return policy?" (15 occurrences)

Recommendation: Add FAQ content for these topics.
```

### Process Improvements

```
Opportunity: Callback Scheduling

Currently, when callers can't talk, agents say "call back anytime."

Suggestion: Offer to schedule a specific callback time using 
calendar integration. Similar companies see 40% higher return rate.
```
