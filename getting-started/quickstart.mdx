# Quickstart Guide

This guide will get you from zero to a working AI agent in 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- An Emanate account ([sign up here](https://app.emanate.ai/signup))
- Your company website URL (for Business DNA extraction)

## Step 1: Complete Onboarding

After signing up, you'll be guided through the onboarding wizard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Your Website URL">
    Emanate automatically extracts your brand context:
    - Company name and tagline
    - Products and services
    - Brand colors and visual style
    - Industry and target audience
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Business DNA">
    Verify the extracted information and make any corrections
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Agent Context">
    Set the tone and personality for your AI agents
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The Business DNA extraction typically completes in 30-60 seconds. This context is used to make all your agents sound authentic to your brand.
</Note>

## Step 2: Create Your First Agent

Navigate to **Agents** → **Voice Agents** → **Create Agent**

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
Name: Sales Assistant
Type: Voice Agent
First Message: "Hi, thanks for calling [Company]. How can I help you today?"
```

### Model Selection

Choose your preferred LLM provider:

| Provider | Model | Best For |
|----------|-------|----------|
| OpenAI | GPT-4o | General purpose, fast |
| Anthropic | Claude 3.5 | Complex reasoning |
| Google | Gemini Pro | Multimodal tasks |

### Voice Selection

Select a voice that matches your brand:

| Provider | Recommended Voices |
|----------|-------------------|
| Cartesia | Sonic (natural, conversational) |
| ElevenLabs | Sarah, Josh (professional) |
| Deepgram | Aura (fast, efficient) |

## Step 3: Add Knowledge Base

Upload documents to give your agent context:

1. Go to the **Knowledge Base** tab
2. Click **Upload Documents**
3. Add your product catalog, FAQ, or sales materials

Supported formats:
- PDF documents
- Word documents (.docx)
- Text files (.txt)
- Markdown (.md)

<Tip>
  Start with your FAQ or most common customer questions. You can always add more documents later.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Configure Lead Capture

Enable automatic lead capture to collect contact information:

1. Go to the **Overview** tab
2. Enable **Lead Capture**
3. Select the fields to capture:
   - Name (required)
   - Email
   - Phone
   - Company
   - Custom fields

The agent will naturally ask for this information during conversations.

## Step 5: Test Your Agent

Use the built-in test panel to verify your agent works correctly:

1. Click the **Test** button in the agent editor
2. Start a test call or chat session
3. Verify:
   - First message sounds correct
   - Agent answers questions from knowledge base
   - Lead capture collects information properly

### Test Checklist

- [ ] First message plays correctly
- [ ] Agent responds to common questions
- [ ] Lead information is captured
- [ ] Handoff triggers work (if configured)

## Step 6: Deploy

Once testing is complete, deploy your agent:

### For Voice Agents

1. Go to **Phone Numbers** tab
2. Click **Add Phone Number**
3. Choose local or toll-free
4. Assign to your agent

Your agent is now live and answering calls!

### For Chat Agents

1. Go to **Widget** tab
2. Copy the embed code
3. Add to your website's HTML

```html
<script src="https://cdn.emanate.ai/widget.js" 
        data-agent-id="YOUR_AGENT_ID">
</script>
```
