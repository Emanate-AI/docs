# Calendar Integration

Enable AI agents to book meetings directly during conversations using calendar integrations.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **Calendly** | Event types, availability, booking |
| **Cal.com** | Open-source, self-hosted option |

## Setting Up Calendly

### Step 1: Connect Calendly

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Calendar**
2. Click **Connect Calendly**
3. Authorize Emanate

### Step 2: Select Event Types

Choose which event types agents can book:

- 15-minute intro call
- 30-minute demo
- 60-minute consultation

### Step 3: Configure Agent

Add calendar tool to agent:

```typescript
tools: [
  {
    type: "function",
    function: {
      name: "book_meeting",
      description: "Book a meeting with our sales team",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          date: { type: "string" },
          time: { type: "string" },
          attendeeEmail: { type: "string" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## Agent Booking Flow

```
Customer: "I'd like to schedule a demo"
Agent: "I'd be happy to help. What day works best for you?"
Customer: "How about Thursday?"
Agent: "I have Thursday at 10am, 2pm, or 4pm available. 
        Which works best?"
Customer: "2pm"
Agent: "Perfect. What email should I send the invite to?"
Customer: "john@acme.com"
Agent: "Great, you're all set for Thursday at 2pm. You'll 
        receive a calendar invite shortly."
```

## Configuration

### Availability Sync

Calendar checks real-time availability:

```typescript
calendar: {
  checkAvailability: true,
  bufferMinutes: 15,
  maxDaysAhead: 30
}
```

### Time Zone Handling

- Agent detects customer time zone
- Offers times in customer's zone
- Books in correct zone

### Booking Confirmation

After booking:
1. Calendar invite sent
2. Confirmation email sent
3. Lead record updated
4. CRM synced (if enabled)

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title="Wrong time zone">
