# CRM Integration

Emanate integrates with popular CRMs via Merge.dev, enabling automatic sync of leads, contacts, and companies.

## Supported CRMs

| CRM | Sync Capabilities |
|-----|-------------------|
| **HubSpot** | Contacts, Companies, Deals, Notes |
| **Salesforce** | Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Tasks |

## Connecting Your CRM

### Step 1: Initiate Connection

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **CRM**
2. Click **Connect CRM**
3. Select your CRM from the list

### Step 2: Authorize Access

You'll be redirected to authorize Emanate:

**For HubSpot:**
- Log in to your HubSpot account
- Select the portal to connect
- Grant requested permissions

**For Salesforce:**
- Log in to Salesforce
- Allow access to Emanate

### Step 3: Configure Sync

After authorization:

1. Review default field mappings
2. Adjust mappings as needed
3. Set sync rules
4. Enable auto-sync

## Field Mapping

### Default Mappings

#### HubSpot

| Emanate | HubSpot |
|---------|---------|
| name | firstname, lastname |
| email | email |
| phone | phone |
| company | company |
| title | jobtitle |
| icpScore | icp_score (custom) |

#### Salesforce

| Emanate | Salesforce |
|---------|------------|
| name | FirstName, LastName |
| email | Email |
| phone | Phone |
| company | Company / Account |
| title | Title |

### Custom Field Mapping

Map to your custom fields:

1. Go to **CRM Integration** → **Field Mapping**
2. Click **Add Mapping**
3. Select Emanate field
4. Select CRM field
5. Save

## Sync Behavior

### Create vs Update

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| New lead, no CRM match | Create new record |
| Lead exists in CRM | Update existing record |
| Duplicate detection | Merge or flag |

### Sync Triggers

| Trigger | When |
|---------|------|
| `on_capture` | Immediately when captured |
| `on_enrich` | After enrichment |
| `on_qualify` | When ICP threshold met |
| `manual` | Only when requested |

### Sync Direction

Currently **one-way** (Emanate → CRM):
- Leads push to CRM
- CRM changes don't sync back

### Note Configuration

noteSettings: {
  includeTranscript: false,
  includeSummary: true,
  includeScore: true,
  includeKeyPoints: true
}
```

## Deduplication

### Matching Strategy

```typescript
deduplication: {
  primary: "email",
  secondary: "phone",
  fallback: "name_company",
  action: "update"  // or "create_new", "skip"
}
```

### Handling Matches

| Match Type | Default Action |
|------------|----------------|
| Email exact | Update record |
| Phone match | Link or update |
| Name + Company | Flag for review |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection failed">
    - Verify OAuth permissions
    - Check CRM user has admin access
    - Try disconnecting and reconnecting
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sync errors">
    - Check required fields are mapped
    - Verify field types match
    - Review error details in sync log
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Duplicates created">
    - Review deduplication settings
    - Check email field mapping
    - Enable duplicate detection
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Start with minimal field mapping and add more as needed. Too many fields can cause sync issues if data is incomplete.
</Tip>

- Map email first (best deduplication key)
- Test with a few leads before enabling auto-sync
- Monitor sync logs regularly
- Keep field mappings documented
