# Build Your First Voice Agent

This tutorial walks you through creating a complete voice agent that can answer calls, qualify leads, and capture contact information.

**Time:** 20-30 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Emanate account, completed Business DNA setup

## What We'll Build

A voice agent that:
- Greets callers professionally
- Answers product questions
- Qualifies leads
- Captures contact information
- Schedules follow-ups

## Step 1: Create the Agent

1. Navigate to **Agents** → **Voice Agents**
2. Click **Create Agent**
3. Enter basic information:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Sales Assistant |
| First Message | "Hi, thanks for calling ABC Materials! I'm here to help with your industrial materials needs. How can I assist you today?" |

## Step 2: Configure the Model

1. Go to **Model** tab
2. Select your LLM:

```yaml
Provider: OpenAI
Model: gpt-4o
Temperature: 0.7
Max Tokens: 2000
```

<Tip>
  Start with GPT-4o for best quality. You can switch to GPT-4o-mini later for faster, cheaper responses if quality is sufficient.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Write the System Prompt

Go to **Instructions** tab and enter:
