# API Reference

Emanate integrates with VAPI for voice and chat AI capabilities. This section covers how to work with the VAPI webhook system.

## VAPI Integration

Emanate uses VAPI (Voice AI Platform) as the core engine for:

- Voice calls (inbound and outbound)
- Chat conversations
- Tool/function calling
- Transcription and recordings

## Webhook Processing

When calls or chats complete, VAPI sends webhook events to Emanate for processing:

1. **End-of-call reports** - Conversation transcript and metadata
2. **Function calls** - Tool invocations during conversations
3. **Status updates** - Call state changes

See the [Webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks) page for details on webhook events and handling.

## Custom Tools

You can create custom tools that agents invoke during conversations. These are configured in the agent editor and can call your own APIs.

Example tool configuration:

```typescript
{
  name: "check_inventory",
  type: "function",
  function: {
    name: "check_inventory",
    description: "Check product availability",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        sku: { type: "string" }
      }
    }
  },
  server: {
    url: "https://your-api.com/inventory"
  }
}
```
