</Tip>

### Step 4: Configure Schedule

#### Calling Hours

Set when calls are made (in contact's local time zone):

| Day | Start | End |
|-----|-------|-----|
| Monday | 9:00 AM | 6:00 PM |
| Tuesday | 9:00 AM | 6:00 PM |

| Thursday | 9:00 AM | 6:00 PM |
| Friday | 9:00 AM | 5:00 PM |
| Saturday | Disabled | |
| Sunday | Disabled | |

#### Time Zone Handling

- Contacts are called in their local time zone
- System automatically determines zone from phone number
- Override with explicit time zone in contact data

### Step 5: Set Pacing

Control call volume:

| Setting | Description | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Calls per hour** | Maximum concurrent calls | Start with 10-20 |
| **Max attempts** | Retries for unanswered | 2-3 attempts |
| **Retry delay** | Hours between attempts | 4-24 hours |

### Step 6: Configure Outcomes

Define what constitutes success:

| Outcome | Trigger |
|---------|---------|
| **Interested** | Lead expresses interest |
| **Meeting Booked** | Appointment scheduled |
| **Not Interested** | Explicit decline |
| **Callback Requested** | Wants follow-up later |
| **Wrong Number** | Number invalid |
| **Opted Out** | Requested no contact |
