# Automated Lead Qualification

This tutorial shows you how to set up automated lead qualification, from capture to scoring to CRM sync.

**Time:** 25-30 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Agent created, Apollo integration (optional)

## What We'll Build

A lead qualification system that:
- Captures leads from conversations
- Enriches with Apollo data
- Scores against your ICP
- Syncs qualified leads to CRM

## Step 1: Configure Lead Capture

### Enable on Your Agent

1. Open your voice or chat agent
2. Go to **Overview** tab
3. Enable **Lead Capture**

### Configure Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Name | Yes | Contact name |
| Email | Yes | For enrichment & follow-up |
| Company | Yes | For company matching |
| Phone | No | Direct contact |
| Project Details | No | Custom field |

### Add to System Prompt

```markdown
## Lead Qualification

During conversations with interested prospects, collect:

### Required Information
1. **Full Name**: "May I have your name?"
2. **Email**: "What's the best email for follow-up?"
3. **Company**: "What company are you with?"

### Qualifying Questions
Ask to understand their needs:
- "What type of materials are you looking for?"
- "What's your project timeline?"
- "Approximately how much quantity do you need?"
- "Are you the decision-maker for this purchase?"

### Collection Approach
- Be conversational, not interrogative
- Explain why you're asking ("So I can send you relevant information...")
- Don't pressure if they decline
```

## Step 2: Set Up Lead Enrichment

### Connect Apollo

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Apollo**
2. Enter your API key
3. Click **Connect**

### Configure Auto-Enrichment

```yaml
Enrichment:
  trigger: on_capture
  min_confidence: 0.7
  fields:
    - title
    - seniority
    - company_size
    - industry
    - linkedin_url
```

## Step 3: Define Your ICP

|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Title Level | VP, Director, Manager | 15% |

## Step 4: Configure Scoring Thresholds

### Score Tiers

| 60-79 | Warm | Standard nurturing |
| 40-59 | Cool | Marketing sequence |
| 0-39 | Cold | Low priority |

### Automated Actions

```yaml
Actions:
  hot_lead:
    score_min: 80
    actions:
      - sync_to_crm
      - notify_sales
      - priority_flag
  
  warm_lead:

  custom_fields:
    icp_score: hubspot.icp_score
    source: hubspot.lead_source
```

## Step 6: Test the Flow

### Test Lead Capture

1. Open agent test panel
2. Simulate a conversation:

```
Agent: "Hi, thanks for calling! How can I help?"
You: "I'm interested in getting a quote for steel beams"
Agent: "I'd be happy to help. May I have your name?"
You: "John Smith"
Agent: "And what company are you with, John?"
You: "Acme Manufacturing"
Agent: "Great! What's the best email to send quote info?"
You: "john@acme-mfg.com"
```

3. Verify lead appears in **Leads** list

### Verify Enrichment

1. Open the captured lead
2. Check enrichment status
3. Verify fields populated:
   - Title
   - Company size
   - Industry

### Check ICP Score

2. Check ICP Score breakdown:
   - Company fit
   - Role fit
   - Intent signals

### Verify CRM Sync
