# Voice Agents

Voice agents handle phone calls with natural, human-like conversation. They can answer inbound calls, make outbound calls, qualify leads, and transfer to human agents when needed.

## Creating a Voice Agent

Navigate to **Agents** → **Voice Agents** → **Create Agent**

### Basic Configuration

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Internal identifier | "Sales Assistant" |
| **First Message** | Opening greeting | "Hi, thanks for calling ABC Materials..." |
| **System Prompt** | Agent instructions | Role, capabilities, guidelines |

### Model Configuration

Select your LLM provider and model:

```typescript
model: {
  provider: "openai",
  model: "gpt-4o",
  temperature: 0.7,
  maxTokens: 2000
}
```

**Recommended Settings:**

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Temperature | 0.7 | Balanced creativity/consistency |
| Max Tokens | 2000 | Sufficient for detailed responses |

### Voice Configuration

Configure text-to-speech:

```typescript
voice: {
  provider: "cartesia",
  voiceId: "a167e0f3-df7e-4d52-a9c3-f949145efdab",
  model: "sonic-3"
}
```

**Voice Providers:**

| Provider | Strengths | Best For |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Cartesia** | Natural, expressive | Most use cases |
| **ElevenLabs** | Highly realistic | Premium experiences |
| **Deepgram** | Fast, efficient | High volume |
| **PlayHT** | Voice cloning | Brand voices |

### Transcriber Configuration

Configure speech-to-text:

```typescript
transcriber: {
  provider: "deepgram",
  model: "nova-3",
  language: "en"
}
```

## Voice Settings

### Interruption Handling

Control how the agent handles being interrupted:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Allow Interruption** | Caller can interrupt agent mid-sentence |
| **Interruption Threshold** | Sensitivity to interruptions (0-1) |

### Silence Handling

Configure behavior during silence:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Max Silence** | Seconds before prompting | 10 |
| **Silence Message** | What to say after silence | "Are you still there?" |

### End Call Conditions

Define when to end calls:

- **Max Duration**: Maximum call length
- **Goodbye Detection**: End on "goodbye" phrases
- **Inactivity Timeout**: End after extended silence

## Phone Numbers

Voice agents need phone numbers to receive/make calls.

### Adding a Phone Number

1. Go to **Phone Numbers** tab in agent editor
2. Click **Add Phone Number**
3. Choose:
   - **Local**: Area code-specific number
   - **Toll-Free**: 1-800 style number

### Phone Number Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fallback Number** | Forward calls when agent unavailable |
| **Voicemail** | Enable/disable voicemail |
| **Recording** | Record all calls |

## System Prompt Best Practices

### Structure

```markdown
## Role
You are [Name], a [role] at [Company].

## Capabilities
- Answer questions about [products/services]
- Qualify leads by understanding needs
- Schedule meetings with sales team

## Guidelines
- Be professional and helpful
- Keep responses concise (2-3 sentences)
- Ask clarifying questions when needed

## Boundaries
- Don't discuss competitor pricing
- Don't make commitments on custom orders
- Transfer to human for complex technical questions
```

### Including Business DNA

Business DNA is automatically injected into prompts:

```markdown
## Company Context
Business: {{businessName}}
Industry: {{industry}}
Products: {{productsServices}}
Target Audience: {{targetAudience}}
```

## Lead Capture

Enable automatic lead capture:

1. Go to **Overview** tab
2. Enable **Lead Capture**
3. Configure fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Name | Yes | Contact name |
| Email | No | Email address |
| Phone | No | Phone number |
| Company | No | Company name |

The agent will naturally collect this information during conversation.

## Transfer Calls

Set up call transfers to human agents:

1. Go to **Custom Actions** tab
2. Add **Transfer Tool**
3. Configure destinations:

```typescript
{
  type: "transferCall",
  destinations: [
    {
      type: "phoneNumber",
      number: "+1234567890",
      description: "Sales Team"
    },
    {
      type: "sipUri", 
      uri: "sip:support@company.com",
      description: "Support Team"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Transfer Triggers

Configure when to transfer:

- Explicit request: "Let me speak to a human"
- Complex questions: Technical queries outside scope
- Escalation: Frustrated customer detection

## Testing Voice Agents

Use the built-in test panel:

1. Click **Test** in agent editor
2. Click **Start Call** to begin test session
3. Speak naturally and verify:
   - First message plays correctly
   - Agent understands speech
   - Responses are appropriate
   - Lead capture works

### Test Scenarios

| Scenario | What to Verify |
|----------|----------------|
| Happy path | Basic Q&A flows correctly |
| Knowledge query | Agent uses knowledge base |
| Lead capture | Information collected |
| Transfer request | Handoff triggers |
| Edge cases | Silence, interruption, unclear speech |

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Vocabulary

Add industry-specific terms for better recognition:

```typescript
transcriber: {
  provider: "deepgram",
  model: "nova-3",
  keywords: ["SKU-1234", "polyethylene", "HDPE"]
}
```

### Conditional Responses

Use the system prompt for conditional behavior:

```markdown
## Routing Logic
- If caller asks about pricing: Collect company info first
- If caller mentions urgent order: Offer to transfer to sales
- If after hours: Offer callback scheduling
```
