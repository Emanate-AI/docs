# ICP Scoring

ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) Scoring uses AI to evaluate how well leads match your target customer, helping sales teams prioritize their efforts.

## Defining Your ICP

ICP scoring evaluates leads against criteria you define. Here's how the scoring works:

### Criteria Categories

#### Company Criteria

| Criterion | Example Values | Weight |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Industry** | Manufacturing, Construction | 25% |
| **Company Size** | 100-1000 employees | 20% |
| **Revenue** | $10M-500M | 15% |
| **Location** | United States, Canada | 10% |

#### Role Criteria

| Criterion | Example Values | Weight |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Title Keywords** | VP, Director, Manager | 15% |
| **Department** | Operations, Procurement | 10% |
| **Seniority** | Executive, Director | 10% |

#### Intent Signals

| Signal | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Requested pricing | +10 |
| Asked about timeline | +10 |
| Mentioned budget | +15 |
| Requested meeting | +20 |
| Mentioned competitor | +5 |

### Weighting

Criteria are weighted to reflect importance:

```typescript
icpWeights: {
  industry: 25,
  companySize: 20,
  revenue: 15,
  location: 10,
  title: 15,
  department: 10,
  seniority: 10,
  intentSignals: 20  // Bonus points
}
```

## Score Calculation

### Scoring Formula

```
Score = Σ (Criterion Match × Weight × 100)
```

### Example Calculation

| Criterion | Match | Weight | Points |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| Industry: Manufacturing | ✓ 100% | 25% | 25 |
| Size: 500 employees | ✓ 100% | 20% | 20 |
| Revenue: $50M | ✓ 100% | 15% | 15 |
| Location: USA | ✓ 100% | 10% | 10 |
| Title: VP | ✓ 100% | 15% | 15 |
| Department: Operations | ✓ 100% | 10% | 10 |
| **Intent Bonus** | +15 | - | +15 |
| **Total** | | | **110** → 100 (capped) |

### Score Tiers

| Score | Tier | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| 80-100 | 🟢 Highly Qualified | Fast-track to sales |
| 60-79 | 🟡 Qualified | Standard follow-up |
| 40-59 | 🟠 Needs Nurturing | Marketing sequence |
| 0-39 | 🔴 Not a Fit | Low priority |

## Intent Analysis

### Conversation Analysis

AI analyzes conversation content for buying signals:

```typescript
intentSignals: {
  urgency: ["need this week", "urgent", "asap"],
  budget: ["budget approved", "have budget", "can spend"],
  authority: ["I decide", "my decision", "I'm the buyer"],
  timeline: ["this quarter", "next month", "by end of year"],
  competition: ["comparing", "looking at options", "vs competitor"]
}
```

### Signal Scoring

| Signal Type | Points | Example |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| BANT - Budget | +15 | "We have $100K budgeted" |
| BANT - Authority | +15 | "I make these decisions" |
| BANT - Need | +10 | "We need to replace our current supplier" |
| BANT - Timeline | +10 | "Looking to purchase this quarter" |
| Competitor Mention | +5 | "We're also talking to XYZ Corp" |

## Automatic Scoring

### Trigger Points

Scoring runs automatically:

1. **On Lead Capture**: Initial score from conversation
2. **After Enrichment**: Updated with company data
3. **On Updates**: Recalculate when data changes

### Score History

Track score changes over time:

```
Lead: John Smith (Acme Corp)
─────────────────────────────
Feb 1: Created          Score: 45
Feb 1: Enriched         Score: 72 (+27)
Feb 3: Follow-up call   Score: 85 (+13)
```

## Using Scores

### Lead Prioritization

Sort and filter leads by score:

1. Go to **Leads**
2. Sort by **ICP Score** (descending)
3. Focus on highest scores first

### Automated Routing

Route leads based on score:

```typescript
routing: {
  rules: [
    { scoreMin: 80, action: "assign_to_ae", notify: true },
    { scoreMin: 60, scoreMax: 79, action: "add_to_sequence" },
    { scoreMax: 59, action: "marketing_nurture" }
  ]
}
```

### CRM Integration

Push scores to CRM:

- HubSpot: Custom property "ICP Score"
- Salesforce: Custom field "ICP_Score__c"

## Customizing Scoring

### Industry-Specific ICP

Create multiple ICP profiles:

```typescript
icpProfiles: [
  {
    name: "Enterprise Manufacturing",
    criteria: { ... },
    weights: { ... }
  },
  {
    name: "Mid-Market Construction",
    criteria: { ... },
    weights: { ... }
  }
]
```

### Negative Signals

Reduce scores for disqualifying factors:

| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Personal email domain | -10 |
| Company size < 10 | -20 |
| Student/Intern title | -15 |
| Wrong industry | -25 |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scores seem too high/low">
    - Review weight distribution
    - Check criterion definitions
    - Adjust thresholds based on closed deals
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Intent signals not detecting">
    - Review conversation transcripts
    - Add more signal keywords
    - Check language variations
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scores not updating">
    - Verify enrichment completed
    - Check scoring triggers
    - Manual recalculate if needed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### Calibrate Regularly

<Tip>
  Review scored leads monthly against actual outcomes. Adjust weights based on which criteria best predict conversions.
</Tip>

### Start Simple

Begin with 5-7 key criteria, then refine:
1. Industry
2. Company size
3. Title level
4. Intent signals

### Use Data

Analyze won/lost deals to identify patterns:
- What did won deals have in common?
- What disqualified lost deals?
- Adjust ICP accordingly
