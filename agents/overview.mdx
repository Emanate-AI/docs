## How Agents Work

Every agent is built on four pillars:

### 1. Language Model

The LLM powers the agent's understanding and responses:

| Provider | Models | Best For |
|----------|--------|----------|
| OpenAI | GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini | General purpose, fast responses |
| Anthropic | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Complex reasoning, nuanced responses |
| Google | Gemini Pro | Multimodal, technical queries |
| Groq | LLaMA 3.1 | Ultra-fast responses |

### 2. System Prompt

The system prompt defines agent behavior:

```
You are a sales assistant for [Company], a leading provider of 
industrial materials. Your role is to:
- Answer questions about our products
- Qualify leads by understanding their needs
- Schedule meetings with sales representatives

Always be professional, helpful, and knowledgeable about our 
product catalog.
```

### 3. Knowledge Base

Documents that provide context:

- Product catalogs
- FAQ documents
- Sales materials
- Technical specifications

### 4. Tools

Custom actions the agent can perform:

- **Function Tools**: Custom API calls (ERP lookup, pricing)
- **Transfer Tools**: Hand off to human agents
- **SMS Tools**: Send text messages
- **Calendar Tools**: Book meetings

## Best Practices

### System Prompts

<Tip>
  **Keep prompts focused.** Define the agent's role clearly and list specific capabilities. Avoid overloading with too many instructions.
</Tip>

```markdown
# Good
You are a product specialist for ABC Materials. Help customers 
find the right materials for their projects.

# Avoid
You are an AI assistant that can help with anything including 
products, support, billing, HR questions, weather...
```

### Knowledge Base

- **Start small**: Begin with your FAQ and top 10 product documents
- **Keep updated**: Refresh documents when products change
- **Structure clearly**: Use headers and bullet points in documents

### Testing

- Test with real customer scenarios
- Verify knowledge base queries work
- Check lead capture extracts data correctly
- Test edge cases (hang-ups, silence, unclear questions)

## Agent Lifecycle

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Agent being configured, not active |
| **Active** | Agent is live and handling conversations |
| **Paused** | Temporarily disabled |
| **Archived** | No longer in use |
