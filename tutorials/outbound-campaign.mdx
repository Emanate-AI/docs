# Launch an Outbound Campaign

This tutorial walks you through creating and launching an outbound voice campaign to reach prospects at scale.

**Time:** 30-40 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Voice agent created, contact list

## What We'll Build

A campaign that:
- Calls contacts from your list
- Delivers personalized messages
- Qualifies and captures leads
- Tracks results in real-time

## Step 1: Prepare Your Contact List

### CSV Format

Create a CSV file with your contacts:

```csv
phone,first_name,last_name,company,email,product_interest
+14155551234,John,Smith,Acme Corp,john@acme.com,steel beams
+14155555678,Jane,Doe,Widget Inc,jane@widget.com,aluminum sheets
+14155559012,Bob,Johnson,BuildCo,bob@buildco.com,steel tubing
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Format | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| phone | E.164 (+1...) | Yes |
| first_name | Text | Recommended |
| last_name | Text | Recommended |

### Clean Your Data

Before uploading:
- Verify phone numbers are valid
- Remove duplicates
- Check for opt-out requests
- Ensure proper E.164 format

## Step 2: Create Campaign Agent

Create a dedicated agent for outbound:

### System Prompt for Outbound

```markdown
## Role
You are calling on behalf of ABC Materials to follow up with 
prospects who may be interested in our industrial materials.

## Opening Script
"Hi, this is Sarah from ABC Materials. I'm reaching out because 
we work with companies like {{company}} in the {{industry}} space. 
Do you have a quick moment?"

## If Yes
"Great! I wanted to see if you're currently sourcing any 
{{product_interest}} for your projects. We've been helping 
companies reduce costs by 15-20% with our new supplier program."

## If Busy
"No problem at all. When would be a better time to chat? 
I can call you back then."

## Objection Handling

### "Not interested"
"I understand. Before I go, can I ask what you're currently using 
for your materials supply? Just so I know for our records."

### "Already have a supplier"
"That's great to hear. Many of our customers came to us after 
comparing options. Would you be open to a quick comparison quote? 
No obligation."

### "Send me information"
"Absolutely. What email should I send that to? And just so I 
send the right materials, what type of products are you most 
interested in?"

## Goal
- Primary: Schedule a meeting with sales
- Secondary: Capture email for follow-up
- Minimum: Understand their current situation

## Call Duration
Keep calls to 2-4 minutes unless prospect is highly engaged.
```

### Configure Voice

```yaml
Provider: Cartesia
Voice: Professional, friendly
Speed: Slightly slower than normal (0.95)
```

## Step 3: Create the Campaign

1. Navigate to **Campaigns** → **Create Campaign**
2. Enter details:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Q1 Follow-up Campaign |
| Description | Follow up with Q4 leads |
| Start Date | (your date) |
| End Date | (your date) |

## Step 4: Upload Contacts

1. Click **Upload Contacts**
2. Select your CSV file
3. Map fields:
   - phone → Phone Number
   - first_name → First Name
   - company → Company
4. Review import summary
5. Click **Import**

## Step 5: Configure Schedule

### Calling Hours

Set appropriate times (contact's local time):

| Day | Start | End |
|-----|-------|-----|
| Monday | 9:00 AM | 5:00 PM |
| Tuesday | 9:00 AM | 5:00 PM |
| Wednesday | 9:00 AM | 5:00 PM |
| Thursday | 9:00 AM | 5:00 PM |
| Friday | 9:00 AM | 4:00 PM |

### Best Practices

- Avoid Monday 9-10 AM (people catching up)
- Avoid Friday afternoon (low engagement)
- Peak times: 10-11 AM, 2-4 PM

## Step 6: Set Pacing

Control call volume:

| Setting | Recommended | Why |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Calls per hour | 20 | Start conservative |
| Max attempts | 3 | Don't over-call |
| Retry delay | 4 hours | Space out retries |

## Step 7: Configure Outcomes

Define what counts as success:

| Outcome | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Meeting Booked | Scheduled with sales |
| Interested | Will follow up |
| Send Info | Wants email materials |
| Not Interested | Clear decline |
| Wrong Number | Number incorrect |
| Do Not Call | Remove from list |
