The onboarding process consists of four main steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Business DNA Setup">
    Extract and configure your brand context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent Creation">
    Build your first voice or chat agent

  </Step>
  <Step title="Team Onboarding">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 1: Business DNA Setup

Business DNA is the foundation of all your AI agents. It ensures every agent interaction feels authentic to your brand.

### Automatic Extraction

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Business DNA**
2. Enter your company website URL
3. Click **Extract Brand**

Emanate automatically extracts:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Business Name | Your company name |
| Tagline | Main value proposition |
| Industry | Business category |
| Products/Services | What you sell |
| Target Audience | Who you serve |
| Brand Colors | Visual identity |
| Tone & Style | Communication style |

### Manual Refinement

After extraction, review and refine:

1. **Business Overview**: Edit the company description for accuracy
2. **Products/Services**: Add or remove items
3. **Brand Values**: Adjust the extracted values
4. **Visual Styles**: Confirm color palette

<Tip>
  Take time to refine the Business DNA — this context is injected into every agent's system prompt and significantly impacts conversation quality.
</Tip>

### Agent Context

Configure how agents should represent your company:

- **Tone**: Professional, friendly, technical, casual
- **Personality**: Helpful, consultative, direct
- **Boundaries**: Topics to avoid, escalation triggers
