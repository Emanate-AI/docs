# Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base provides AI agents with context from your documents. Upload product catalogs, FAQs, and sales materials to give agents the information they need to answer customer questions accurately.

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: Add documents to the knowledge base
2. **Process**: Documents are chunked and indexed
3. **Query**: Agent retrieves relevant chunks during conversations

## Uploading Documents

### Supported Formats

| Format | Extension | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| PDF | `.pdf` | Product catalogs, brochures |
| Word | `.docx` | Sales materials, guides |
| Text | `.txt` | FAQs, simple docs |
| Markdown | `.md` | Structured content |

### Upload Process

1. Navigate to **Knowledge Base** tab in agent editor
2. Click **Upload Documents**
3. Select files (drag & drop or browse)
4. Wait for processing to complete

### File Size Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Max file size | 10 MB |
| Max files per agent | 50 |
| Max total size | 100 MB |

## Document Structure

### Best Practices

<Tip>
  Well-structured documents lead to better agent responses. Use clear headings, bullet points, and organized sections.
</Tip>

**Good Document Structure:**

```markdown
# Product: Steel Beams

## Overview
Steel beams are structural components used in construction...

## Specifications
- Material: A992 Grade 50 Steel
- Sizes: W4x13 to W44x335
- Length: Up to 60 feet

## Applications
- Commercial buildings
- Bridges
- Industrial facilities

## Pricing
Contact sales for current pricing. Volume discounts available.
```

**Avoid:**

- Scanned images without OCR
- Complex tables without context
- Documents with only headers (no content)

### Document Categories

Organize documents by type:

| Category | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| **Products** | Catalogs, spec sheets, datasheets |
| **FAQ** | Common questions and answers |
| **Policies** | Shipping, returns, warranties |
| **Sales** | Pricing guides, comparisons |

## Query Tools

Knowledge base documents are accessed via query tools:

### Query Tool Configuration

```typescript
{
  type: "query",
  function: {
    name: "query_knowledge_base",
    description: "Search product documentation for information"
  },
  knowledgeBaseId: "kb_123..."
}
```

## Document Management

### Viewing Documents

1. Go to **Knowledge Base** tab
2. View list of uploaded documents
3. Click a document to see details:
   - File name and type
   - Upload date
   - Processing status
   - Chunk count

### Updating Documents

When content changes:

1. Delete the old document
2. Upload the updated version
3. Wait for reprocessing

<Note>
  Documents are re-indexed after upload. Allow 1-2 minutes for processing before testing.
</Note>

### Deleting Documents

1. Go to **Knowledge Base** tab
2. Click the delete icon on the document
3. Confirm deletion

Deleted documents are immediately removed from the agent's context.

## Processing Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Uploading** | File being uploaded |
| **Processing** | Document being chunked and indexed |
| **Ready** | Available for agent queries |
| **Error** | Processing failed |

### Troubleshooting Processing

If a document fails to process:

1. Check file format is supported
2. Verify file isn't corrupted
3. Ensure file size is under limit
4. Try re-uploading

## Knowledge Base Best Practices

### Content Quality

- **Be specific**: Include product names, SKUs, exact specifications
- **Be complete**: Don't assume knowledge, spell everything out
- **Be current**: Update documents when products change

### Organization

- **One topic per document**: Don't mix unrelated content
- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive file names
- **Regular updates**: Review and refresh periodically

### Testing

After adding documents:

1. Test queries in the agent test panel
2. Ask questions you expect customers to ask
3. Verify responses are accurate
4. Adjust documents if needed

## Multiple Knowledge Bases

Agents can access multiple knowledge bases:

### Use Cases

- **Product KB**: Technical specifications
- **Policy KB**: Shipping, returns, warranties
- **FAQ KB**: Common questions

### Configuration

```typescript
knowledgeBases: [
  { id: "kb_products", name: "Product Catalog" },
  { id: "kb_policies", name: "Company Policies" },
  { id: "kb_faq", name: "FAQ" }
]
```

The agent automatically queries the most relevant knowledge base based on the question.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent doesn't use knowledge base">
    - Verify documents are in "Ready" status
    - Check query tool is configured
    - Test with explicit questions matching document content
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Responses are inaccurate">
    - Review source documents for accuracy
    - Improve document structure
    - Add more context/detail to documents
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Processing takes too long">
    - Large PDFs take longer to process
    - Split large documents into smaller files
    - Check for complex formatting that slows processing
  </Accordion>
