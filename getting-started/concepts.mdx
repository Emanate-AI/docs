## Agents

### Assistant

An **Assistant** is an AI-powered agent configured to handle conversations. Each assistant has:

- **System Prompt**: Instructions that define behavior and personality
- **Model**: The LLM powering the agent (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, etc.)
- **Voice**: For voice agents, the text-to-speech voice
- **Knowledge Base**: Documents providing context
- **Tools**: Custom actions the agent can perform

### Voice Agent

A voice agent handles phone calls. It includes:

- **Transcriber**: Speech-to-text (Deepgram Nova-3)
- **Voice**: Text-to-speech (Cartesia, ElevenLabs)
- **Phone Number**: The number callers dial

### Chat Agent

A chat agent handles website conversations via an embedded widget. It includes:

### Lead Enrichment

**Lead Enrichment** appends additional data to leads via Apollo.io:

- Job title

### ICP Scoring

**ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) Scoring** rates how well a lead matches your target customer:

- **Score**: 0-100 rating
- **Factors**: Industry, company size, role, intent signals

## Campaigns

### Voice Campaign

A **Voice Campaign** is an automated outbound calling program:

- **Contact List**: Phone numbers to call

- **Schedule**: When calls are made
- **Pacing**: Calls per hour limit

### Campaign Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Campaign being configured |
| **Scheduled** | Waiting to start |
| **Running** | Actively making calls |
| **Paused** | Temporarily stopped |
| **Completed** | All contacts processed |

## Analytics

### Call Log

A **Call Log** records every voice call:

- Call duration
- Transcript

- Outcome (completed, voicemail, no answer)
- Lead captured (if any)

### Chat Log

A **Chat Log** records every chat session:

- Messages exchanged
- Session duration
- Outcome

### Evaluation

An **Evaluation** is a quality assessment of a conversation:

- **Criteria**: Greeting, product knowledge, objection handling
- **Score**: Per-criteria and overall rating
- **Feedback**: AI-generated improvement suggestions

### Insights

**Insights** are AI-generated performance analyses:

- Trend identification
- Anomaly detection
- Improvement recommendations

## Technical Concepts

### VAPI

**VAPI** is the Voice AI Platform that powers Emanate's voice and chat capabilities. Key concepts:

- **Assistant**: VAPI's term for an AI agent configuration
- **Call**: A voice conversation session
- **Chat**: A text conversation session
- **Tool**: A function the agent can invoke

### Business DNA

**Business DNA** is Emanate's brand context system:

- **Extraction**: Automatic scraping of brand info from your website

- **Agent Context**: Personality and tone settings

### Webhook

A **Webhook** is an HTTP callback triggered by events:

- `call.ended`: Voice call completed
- `session.updated`: Chat session updated

### Structured Output

A **Structured Output** is a schema for extracting data from conversations:

- **Lead Capture**: Contact information extraction
- **Conversation Metrics**: Intent, sentiment, outcome

## Data Flow

### "VAPI Writes, Supabase Reads"

Emanate uses a specific data pattern:

1. **Writes** go to VAPI first (source of truth)
2. **Syncs** copy data to Supabase after writes
3. **Reads** come from Supabase (fast, cached)

This ensures:
- Consistent data across the platform
- Fast list/detail views
- Reliable state management
