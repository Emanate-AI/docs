## What is Emanate?

Emanate provides AI-powered agents that autonomously handle customer interactions across voice and chat channels. Built specifically for industrial materials companies, Emanate agents can:

- **Answer inbound calls** and qualify leads 24/7
- **Run outbound campaigns** to reach prospects at scale
- **Capture lead information** directly from conversations
- **Enrich contacts** with company and contact data via Apollo.io
- **Sync to your CRM** (HubSpot, Salesforce) automatically

## Core Capabilities

### AI Agents

Create voice and chat agents that understand your business context, products, and customer needs. Agents are powered by your choice of LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and can be customized with:

- Custom system prompts and instructions
- Knowledge base documents for context
- Custom actions (ERP lookups, calendar booking, etc.)
- Lead capture and qualification workflows

### Lead Pipeline

Every conversation is an opportunity. Emanate automatically:

1. **Captures** contact information from agent conversations
2. **Enriches** leads with Apollo.io data (title, company, LinkedIn)
3. **Scores** leads against your Ideal Customer Profile
4. **Syncs** qualified leads to your CRM with full context

### Campaign Management

Run outbound voice campaigns with:

- Automated dialing and call scheduling
- Real-time monitoring and alerts
- Call transcripts and recordings
- Performance analytics

## Architecture Overview

Emanate is built on a modern stack designed for reliability and performance:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Next.js (App Router)            Frontend & API                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  VAPI                            Voice & Chat AI Platform       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Supabase                        Database                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Integrations                    Apollo, HubSpot, Resend        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

<Note>
  **Key Pattern:** "VAPI writes, Supabase reads" — All mutations go through VAPI as the source of truth, while reads come from Supabase for instant performance.
